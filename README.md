# ScriptsByMacha
Welcome to my little cyber-portfolio! This is an aggregation of random scripts I've made that I don't mind sharing to demonstrate some of my skills and capabilities. 
I enjoy building small automation scripts, custom IoT stuff, and various game development projects. I'm currently in the process of pushing in a range of some python scripts, C# scripts, and shell scripts.
I'm treating this repo as a mini-portfolio for all the random personal junk I work on during my spare time that can't fit inside a box.  This is NOT intended to be a functional
package. A lot of the things I like to work on and play around with don't really fit into a box, or aren't significant enough to be it's own repo or project, so I store them 
here. Read/Copy/Modify whatever's in here at your leisure.
